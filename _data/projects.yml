  description: Can we perform whole-program analysis of a given Java application without analyzing the whole program? Through light-weight static analyses of the structure of a given application, we have shown that the answer to this question is 'yes'. Moreover, we developed Averroes, a placeholder library generator that enables the use of that suite in any Java whole-program analysis framework. Using Averroes reduces the amount of code that needs to be analyzed by up to 600x, improving the performance of call graph analysis as it becomes up to 7x faster, and uses up to 6x less memory.
  impact: Averroes is currently used by the major Java static analysis frameworks, <a href="https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki/Extensions-to-Soot" target="_blank">Soot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wala/WALA/wiki/WALA-Based-Tools" target="_blank">WALA</a>, and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop" target="_blank">DOOP</a>.
