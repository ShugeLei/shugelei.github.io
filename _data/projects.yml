  description: Develop a physics-informed deep learning framework that enables multi-fidelity modeling, and uncertainty quantification to bridge inputs, e.g. materials properties and process conditions to outputs, e.g. fluid velocity and pressure distributions and melt pool dimensions. Generate a data-driven model that expresses essential theoretical understandings and reproduces the predictive capability from both computational and experimental data.
